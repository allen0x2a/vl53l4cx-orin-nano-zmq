# vl53l4cx-orin-nano-zmq
Python driver for the VL53L4CX Time-of-Flight sensor, specifically optimized for the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano. This implementation bypasses the heavy Arduino HAL libraries, offering a lightweight ZeroMQ publisher for 4-wire (I2C) breakout boards. Ideal for low-latency robotics and proximity sensing.
